#### Functional BETA version ####

Cryptographic system to encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify, generate keys and more written in Python 3

##### Tested with Python 3.4.2 on Windows 8.1 #####
###### Expected works with Python 3.2 or upper in all supported platforms by this one ######

##### Python Modules dependencies: #####
* pycrypto (tested with 2.6.1)
* ecdsa (tested with 0.11)

###### How to install Python Modules dependencies: ######
1. Install pip (python package manager)
2. Install packages with pip:
  * pip install pycrypto
  * pip install ecdsa
(Other methods are available)

###### Run it from command line ######
python crypto.py
(Other methods are available)

The command line interface is only in catalan for now

TODO List:
* More languages
* More variations of the algorithms (for example all AES versions)
* Improve the code (method extraction and other refactors)
* Improve the usage with cli (-- style)
* Add testing
